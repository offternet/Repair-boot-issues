Following will help with fixing a No Boot situation to a filesystem that is using Grub Bootloader.

If you are reading this hopefully its when your GNU/Linux system is still botting with Grub/Grub2. If so, make a bootable USB thumb drive
that can be used in the future to help in recovering a grub fails to boot situation.

Issue: Grub2 (Dumps to Grub prompt or you never see a Grub Menu on failed boot)
       - Boot from a non-live linux usb stick, hard drive or recovery cd.
       - open terminal and remove all grub from system. When it asks if you want to remove all settings, answer yes.
       - Run Command $-> sudo apt-get purge grub-common
          (after grub is removed, do NOT!!!!!! reboot or shutdown, REINSTALL GRUB !!!! /dev/sda "or what your boot hard drive is)
          - Run Command $-> sudo grub-install /dev/sxx
            (if you have a multi-boot linux system and you see MULTIBLE Kernels / linux names - DONE !)
            (if you fail to see all boot partitions after grub installs, REBOOT and system should boot without Grub menu.)
            - Run Command once again $-> sudo update-grub 
              (You should see all kernel / linux names now - Done)
              (If still error, see below)

Issue: Grub2 (Will not set correct 3rd entry in Menuentry)
Issue: "Gave up waiting for Resume"
Issue: initrams (dump to prompt)

Note:  It is easier to fix these issues if you have a USB Stick with Debian GUI or Ubuntu LTS was installed; not Live System. 
       You can not update-grub from a Live System. 
       If you use a Live DVD or USB Stick you will need to install that live to anoter hard drive partition or USB Stick; and
       Then do the below fixes.
       
       As used below:  "x" is the number of your device "Drive" assigned to our hard drive or USB stick that you want to fix.
       As used below:  "X" is the letter of the partition you want to fix.
       
Needed:  USB Stick that has Debian or Ubuntu Distro installed (not Live DVD or USB)

=================================================================

**issue: Grub2 (Dump to Grub prompt)

  1. Boot Debian or Ubuntu USB Stick
  
  2. Open Terminal and run sudo commands:
  
        sudo grub-install /dev/sdx
        
        sudo update-grub
        
        sudo blkid
        
    (Record uuid= number "without double quotes" for first partition of drive you are tryng to fix (for example /dev/sda1)
        /dev/sda1: UUID="a8ee372d-07d5-4912-a103-503c5ecc063c"
        
  3. Reboot to USB Stick
  
  4. Highlight the first partition on drive you are trying to fix (for example) /dev/sda1 
        press "e" key
        Verify all entries for uuid= are same, If not same, verity your correct uuid= for first partition
        Use arrow keys past uuid= number and use backspace to delete uuid= number
        Manually type in corect uuid= number
        Press F10 to boot with all correct uuid= number for first partition of drive you are trying to fix.
        
  5. Now that you have booted successfully to first partition of drive you are wanting to fix, run this sudo command:
  
          sudo update-grub
          
  6. Reboot to drive that you are trying to fix
        Highlight first partition of drive
        Press "e" key. Verify all uuid= number are same. If not, got to step: Issue: Grub (will not set correct 3rd entry in Menuentry)
        
        
 ===============================================================
 
**Issue: Grub2 (Will not set correct 3rd entry in Menuentry)

This step assumes you fix Grub boot issue (Grub Dumps to Prompt) above.

  1. Boot to drive effected.
  2. ightlight first partition and press "e" key
  3. Type the correct uuid= number in 3rd location (or all locations if necessary)
  4. Press "F10" key to boot in to first partition of effected drive.
  5. Connect to internet
  6. Open Terminal and run the following sudo commands:
  
          sudo apt remove grub grub2 grub-common
          
          sudo apt install grub2 grub-common
          
  7. Reboot
  8. Boot to any partition you want. (Should be fixed now).
  
  ================================================================
  
  **Issue: "Gave up waiting for Resume"
  
       Note: This issue is usually wrong uuid= number used in root partition and/or swap partiton in the following file(s):
       
              Debian systems: /etc/fstab and /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume files
              
              Ubuntu 16.04+ /etc/fstab file only (Ubuntu does not have a resume file at /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d)
             
             
  1. Boot to the patition that has Resume error.
  2. Open terminal and run this sudo command:
  
        sudo blkid
        
     (Record uuid= number "without double quotes" of the partition you are booted to "The patition with resume error")
     
  3. In termainal you will need to correct the uud= number for partition(s)
  
       sudo nano /etc/fstab
       
     (Use cursor keys to end of uuid= Number(s) that are not correct paritions root and/or swap.
     replace it by deleting with backspace key, manually typ in correct uuid= number
     To Save chagnes --> Press & Hold "CTRL KEY" + "x" key --> Press "y" key --> Press "Enter Key")
     
     (This next step is not required in Ubuntu System)
     
       sudo nano /etc/initramfs-toos/conf.d/resume
       
     (make sure file format is like this with correct uuid= number)
     
     RESUME=UUID=CORRECT NUMBER
     
     (To Save chagnes --> Press & Hold "CTRL KEY" + "x" key --> Press "y" key --> Press "Enter Key")
     
  4. Run these sudo commands:
  
       sudo update-initramfs -u
       
       sudo update-grub
     
  4. Reboot
  
  5. Boot to same partiton you just fixed and verify "Resume error is gone".
